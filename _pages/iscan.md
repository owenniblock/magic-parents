### 1. Who needs to refer your child to ISCAN?

The ISCAN service accepts referrals for children who have two or more developmental needs
or there is a neuro-developmental query for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

All referrals into ISCAN must be made by a professional e.g. school or GP. A referral made by
the school is preferable as the teacher spends so much time with your child. The ISCAN
service cannot accept self-referrals by a parent.

### 2. What evidence is needed to go to the ISCAN team meeting?

The referral form needs to be fully completed with as much information as possible:

- What is the question you are asking ISCAN to address?
- Reason for referral & area of need for child / young person? Has the child been
previously referred to ISCAN?
- Birth, development & medical history
- Educational history
- Family history – please list siblings and ages. Please note any siblings with additional
needs
- Current functional impact on child / young person within the home, school and the
community?
- Referrer’s expectations from this referral
- Parent’s expectations from this referral
To support the referral, the ISCAN service also require:
- Schedule of growing skills (SOGS) – this is completed by the health visitor for referrals
for children under the age of 5 years.
- Neuro-developmental teacher questionnaire (if the referral is querying ASD or ADHD)
- Individual Education Plan (IEP) that has been reviewed twice in school
- Parental statement – this is not mandatory but it is helpful
- A statement by the young person - this is not mandatory but it is helpful

### 3. Who attends the ISCAN team meetings?

All ISCAN team meetings are chaired by the ISCAN co-ordinator and notes are taken by the
ISCAN administrator.

Also present at the ISCAN team meeting are:

- Paediatrician
- Members of the ISCAN neuro-developmental team
- Occupational Therapist
- Physiotherapist
- Speech & Language Therapist
- Child Development Advisor
- ISCAN Care Co-ordinator
- Educational Psychologist
- Children with disabilities team

Unfortunately we are unable to have parents present at the meetings. However, the
referrer is welcome to request attendance if they think this would support the referral
discussion.

### 4. How long is waiting list for discussion at an ISCAN team meeting?

There is no waiting list – a referral is listed for discussion as soon as the ISCAN service have all
the completed and relevant information. All referrals regarding a developmental query are
discussed within three weeks upon receiving the referral. Neuro-developmental referrals are
discussed within eight weeks of receiving the referral as it may take a little longer to gather
all the additional information from school and parents.

### 5. If accepted, how long is waiting list to get to assessment stage?

If your child is accepted by therapies e.g. occupational therapy, speech & language therapy,
the waiting list is approximately 14 weeks.

If your child is accepted by the paediatrician, the waiting list is approximately 26 weeks.
If you child is accepted for a neuro-developmental assessment, the waiting list is
approximately 26 weeks.

### 6. How will I know the outcome of the discussion?

All ISCAN referrals that are discussed at an ISCAN team meeting are followed up with an
outcome report sent directly to the parents of the child. This is copied into the referrer, the
school, the GP and the Educational Psychologist.

If your child has been accepted for a neuro-developmental assessment, you will be sent
questionnaires to be completed by yourself and the school. The completed forms should be
sent back as soon as possible and they will be placed in your child’s file.

### 7. Can you be re-referred if refused by panel and if so how?

The original referrer can make a re-referral within six months and must include any additional
new information to support the original referral. The referral will be discussed again at an
ISCAN team meeting.

### 8. What do we need to take to the neuro-developmental assessment and what happens?

You will be contacted directly to arrange the initial appointment to start your child’s neurodevelopmental assessment so please make sure your contact details are correct.
The initial appointment is for both parent and child. You will see two members of the neurodevelopmental team – one will meet with the parent to gather all the developmental history
for your child. The second clinician will complete a child observation with your child in the
next room.

Sometimes, it might be necessary to arrange a school observation. You will not be
informed of the date and time of this observation as the neuro-developmental team need
to be able to observe your child as naturally as possible.

Once all the information has been gathered and the report is complete, you will be
contacted to arrange a feedback appointment.

#### 9. Do ISCAN cover both ASD and ADHD?

Yes. The term `neuro-developmental` covers autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The GP does not complete ADHD assessments.

### 10. Who do I contact to find out where we are in the system?

The ISCAN service welcomes any calls from parents or professionals and we will do our utmost
to help.

### 11. If the outcome is no diagnosis, can we get re-referred if we disagree with it?

All feedback appointments are carried out face to face with the parent only. Children are only
invited if they are over 14 years old. The clinician will go through the whole report and discuss
their findings with you.

If you do not agree that the outcome is ‘no diagnosis’, please talk to the clinician.
If you want to request a second opinion, please contact your ISCAN co-ordinator who will
liaise with the ISCAN ND team.

### 12. What help is there post-diagnosis?

In the first instance, parents are invited to attend an Essentials workshop which covers:

- Language and communication
- Managing meltdowns and anxiety
- Self care
- Attention & concentration
- Sleep

Unfortunately, the ISCAN service does not currently offer a post-diagnostic service.

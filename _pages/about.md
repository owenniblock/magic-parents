MAGIC - working in Monmouthshire and the surrounding areas to support children and young people with disabilities and their families.

We are an independent parent-led group running social groups, activities and events throughout the year and providing a support network for our parents and carers across the South Wales area.

Please use our Facebook page to ask questions, network and find out about forthcoming activities and meetings.

MAGIC - supporting parent carers and their families across south Wales.

We are a volunteer run, parent-led group providing peer-to-peer support, social groups, parent carer workshops and family activities across the South Wales area.

Please join [our Facebook group](https://facebook.com/groups/477529559024217) to meet other parent carers

## Our History

MAGIC began in 2013 when a small group of parents of young people with additional needs wanted to provide a network for parent carers to find information, to meet other parent carers and to provide somewhere for peer to peer support.
